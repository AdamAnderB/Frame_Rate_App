## Overview
The Frame Rate Shiny App is designed to help researchers explore the effects of participant median frame rates on data analysis in eye-tracking studies. It provides an interface to adjust bin sizes and observe the resulting changes in data aggregation and analysis outcomes.

## Features
- **Interactive Frame Rate Analysis**: Users can manipulate frame rate thresholds to see how they affect the visibility of data patterns.
- **Bin Size Adjustments**: Allows users to experiment with different time bin sizes to find the optimal setting for their specific study needs.

## Usage
1. Access the app through this link: [Frame Rate Shiny App](https://adam-a-bramlett.shinyapps.io/Frame_Rate_App/)
2. Use the controls to adjust the median frame rate and bin size.
3. Observe how these changes impact the analysis of eye-tracking data.
